Scripts
-------
There are two possibilities, how to integrate the glTF 2.0 exporter into Blender: 

One possibility is to set this folder as the 'Scripts' folder in File - User Preferences ... - File. Advantage is, that any update to the exporter is automoatically visible by Blender. Drawback is, that the 'Scripts' folder is just used for the glTF 2.0 Python modules.

Otherwise, copy the io_scene_gltf2 folder to the 'scripts' folder of your Blender installation.

In both cases, enable the glTF 2.0 exporter under Import - Export.
