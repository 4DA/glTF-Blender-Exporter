Scripts
-------
There are two possibilities, how to integrate the glTF 2.0 exporter into Blender: 

One possibility is to set this folder as the `Scripts` folder.
For this, open the `User Preferences...` dialog in Blender.

Switch to the `File` tab and set the `Scripts` entry to this folder.

Advantage is, that any update to the exporter is automoatically visible by Blender. Drawback is, that the `Scripts` folder is just used for the glTF 2.0 Python modules.

Otherwise, copy the `io_scene_gltf2` folder to the `scripts/addons` folder of your Blender installation.

In both cases, enable the glTF 2.0 exporter under the `Add-ons` tab.
